Everybody wants the perfect relationship, they wanna be like Bey and Jay or Barack and Mitchele. Getting to the point of this much solidity requires a lot of input from both people involved in a relationship but even before you think of becoming a collective, you need to first work on your self, make yourself a better person before deciding to be a part of someone else's life and accepting them fully, flaws and all. Here is my list of DO'S AND DONT'S that contribute to having a solid relationship that works and has loyalty to the end.

#### THE DO'S OF A SOLID RELATIONSHIP

![relationships](./img/love9.jpg)

_**DO! BE FORGIVING BUT NOT NAIVE**_

![relationships](./img/love3.jpg)

We are all human and therefore we are subject to make mistakes. Being in a relationship requires alot of sacrifice from both partners and also alot of forgiveness. So if your partner makes a mistake and apologises for that mistake, you should definitely try to forgive them and work towards a workable resolution. But this doesn't mean you should be naive and allow someone to take advantage of the kindness of your soul, have boundaries yes but be forgiving as well.

_**DO! TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM EVERYDAY**_

![relationships](./img/love8.jpg)

Don't go a day without saying these words but don't just be a person whose all talk and no action. Let your expression of love be shown not only in words but also in your actions.

**DO! ACCEPT AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU MISTAKE**\_

![relationships](./img/love5.jpg)

As a said earlier, ain't nobody perfect and we all make mistakes. So if your in a relationship and do wrong by partner, you should definitely take responsibility for your mistake and accept that you were wrong. Having to drag an apology out of someone can be exasperating, so instead of going through all this, just take the easier route out and be responsiblefor all your actions because all of them have consequences.

_**DO! MEET THEM HALFWAY**_

![relationships](./img/love4.jpg)

Everything in a relationship is about everyone pulling in their weight. In order for it to work, both of ya'll need to put in equal effort. Don't just let one person do everything for example; they're the ones always calling or texting to check up on you, NAH, let there be a balance where both of ya'll check up on one another by calling, texting etc. This balance enables one to feel like they ain't doing too much or acting desperate because if you respect your worth you wouldn't wanna wreak of desperation. Keep in mind relationships are always 50/50 so if your doing too much, then you should definitely walk away because that ain't the right person for you.

_**DO! HAVE LOYALTY AND COMMITTMENT**_

![relationships](./img/love6.jpg)

For two people to get into a relationship, they have to both be willing to be with one another until the end. So a great quality to ensure ya'll last foreover is to be loyal and committed to the relationship, this means that, YES, there are many other attractive people out there and also people who will just wanna ruin the great thing ya'll got going on but you should not allow them and therefore you should not easily fall into temptation.

_**DO! KEEP A MENTAL NOTE OF IMPORTANT DATES**_

![relationships](./img/couple2.jpg)

On the lowlow, to women it's really important if you remember special dates like anniversaries, birthdays and any other special moments, so guys please don't forget. A helpful tip; You can try marking that specific date on ypu phone calendar and set it to repeat yearly.

_**DO! KNOW AND RESPECT YOUR PARTNER**_

![relationships](./img/couple4.jpg)

It's your responsibility to know and have respect for your partner. Nobody wants to be with someone who treats them less than their worth, so if you want a long lasting relationship, you gotta show mad respect for partner in all situations. You also have the resposibility of knowing your partner inside and out. This means that you can be able to tell what will piss them off or make them happy even if its something done on the lowlow, so take interest in your partner and understand them completely.

#### THE DONT'S YOU SHOULD AVOID

![relationships](./img/heartbreak.jpg)

_**DONT! TRY TO CHANGE SOMEONE**_

![relationships](./img/fight4.jpg)

Most of us fail to realise that we are not all governed by the same principles. You get attracted to a person and have this forced perception about how they are based on what you think your perfect match needs to have. As a result, you end up getting frustrated when they fail to act as how you anticipated they'd act and you instead try to change them. When you decide to get into a relationship, you accept the person the way they are and you learn to compromise living by each others principles because lets face it, Change is hard, ain't nobody gonna change who they are and if you don't love them the way they are, then they ain't for you.

_**DONT! BE NEEDY**_

![relationships](./img/nottalking.jpg)

Phew chile, being needy is one of many peoples' turn off's truth be told. Don't be the type of partner whose always calling numerous times, like 10 times in a day, texting them all the time as if you are idol and have nothing better to do. Being overbearing can make a person lose interest automatically because they feel suffocated and lack peace of mind. Imagine this, someone is always looming over your shoulder like a cloud watching everything you do 24/7, you don't even have breathing space. That's how it looks like when you portray this being needy quality. So check on your partner yes but also give them their personal space because their lives don't only revolve around you.

_**DONT! PORTRAY INSECURE BEHAVIOURS**_

![relationships](./img/fight.jpg)

My friends and i can attest to this, if you always getting jealous because your partner for example is talking to someone of the opposite sex and doing things such as snooping through your partners phone when they are not around, NAH this ain't right! The foundation of a relationship is trust and if you can't respect your partners privacy and don't believe their loyalty is to you, then its better to just walk away rather than always being as master detectiveand looking like a fool when you find out you was out of place and in the process sabotage your own relationship.

_**DONT! BREAK PARTNER CONFIDENTIALITY**_

![relationships](./img/fight2.jpg)
Well, you and bae getting closer with time, you tend to spill a little tea about yourself to your partner in confidence. This is not wrong because you have to have some level of trust in you in order to open up some of your secrets to someone else. The problem comes in when instead of you keeping that information, you go around telling everybody, this especially happens when you guys for example have a fight that may need you to have a break, then you go devulging their secrets, this is not right. Whatever happens between two people in a relationship, it should stay between them no matter the circumstance. Breaching such information could lead to an infinite breakup because who'll wanna be with a personlike that?

_**DONT! BELITTLE THEIR DREAMS**_

![relationships](./img/dreams.jpg)

We all have big dreams of for example; owning cars, houses etc. Some people have the tendency of not being supportive to a person's dream, that's entirely okay, you don't have to support their dream but you have no right whatsover to belittle your partner's dream. Inasmuch as you do not see the vision of his/her dreams, don't talk ill about it, just speak your mind and say why you don't see their vision. You can even weigh in and say what you think works, this is called positive criticism.

_**DONT! TAKE SOMEONE FOR GRANTED**_

![relationships](./img/fight1.jpg)

You fought to have your partner but now that you have them, you start treating them like thay ain't shit, this is not right. You should still have the same psyche you had for your partner the day you first met and you should make an effort to make your partner feel special every single day. Personally, if am treated like a queen that i am on a daily, why the hell would i ever think of leaving or look for someone better?
