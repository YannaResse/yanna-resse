#### _**WHAT IS APPETITE?**_

![appetite ](./img/appetite3.jpg)

Appetite is the feeling you get that drives you to want to eat something especially when you are hungry. There are however, other foods that are appealing and stimulate you to get an appetite, maybe from the smell of the food or even just from how the food looks. So if you don't have an active appetite, follow this easy steps and up your food intake levels.

Tips;

1. _**Try taking porridge oftenly**_

I am pretty sure we have all at one point taken porridge in our lifetime but being a fun of porridge is completely subjective because some of us may not really like it but some of us are a big fun of it. Well, hopefully if you do have an appetite problem then you can be willing to give it a try. I recommend porridge to help increase your appetite because when you do take porridge you become full for only a couple of hours then you begin feeling hungry. Hunger is one driving force for one to feel like they wanna have something in they stomachs, so next time you struggle with food, try taking a cup of porridge beforehand.

2. _**Make sure you eat what you love eating**_

It is much easier for you to wanna eat if you love what your eating, so you can keep some of your favourite snacks in hand and also regularly buy your favourite foods. For example, if you are a big fan of chapattis or lets say 'choma', when you know that you are going to be having these as lunch or supper, your craving to have the food in your mouth will naturally increase and once the food is ready, you will wanna eat. So stock up on foods that you love and if you are not the one that cooks in your household, try giving suggestions to whoever does.

3. _**Avoid eating alone**_

If you have ever eaten alone, am sure you know how boring it is, it is actually an appetite killer. So if you live alone, you can try inviting a friend over so that y'all can eat together because it will be fun and two you will be even more motivated to eat. Having other people around you is also a good idea because they will act like your accountability partners, making sure that you have eaten. If you cannot have friends over, then try eating while watching television because you will concentrate more on the show and end up eating more.

4. _**Avoid drinking while eating**_

By drinking, i don't necessarily mean alcoholic drinks but rather all drinks inclusive of soft drinks. Drinking while eating will fill up your stomach faster leaving less room for food. If you feel really thirsty while having a meal try taking just a sip of water and you will drink as soon as your done with your meal. But the better way to go is by drinking water in between meals and not during meals.

5. _**Use spices to cook your meals**_

Using spices while cooking is also something very subjective because it does depend on a person. But if you are a fluid person, you can definitely try using spices that have a nice smell for example, cinnamon, masala, oregano, rosemary among others. Spices create wonderful aromas that are more appealing to your stomach and will make you get a craving for the food being prepared. Try experimenting with different spices to create a wonderful fragrance that will convince you to wanna eat. Also avoid foods with off putting odours for example cheese, if you dont really like the smell of a key ingredient in a meal, do not use it as it will likely put you off if you wanted to eat it.

6. _**Avoid skipping breakfast**_

We've all probably heard the phrase "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day". Well, it is true, but some of us, me included, we miss breakfast or have at one point missed having breakfast. Skipping breakfast often leads you to eat less throughout the day, so try not avoiding it. So if you are trying to have an appetite do not skip breakfast at all cost.

7. _**Try Reefer ONLY if its your thing**_

We all know pot stimulates appetite because it increase ghrelin and leptin, the hormones associated with appetite. Pot may make you find food to be tastier and better smelling and it could make you feel hungry even when your stomach is full. If it is _**LEGAL**_ and you like it, you can talk to your doctor about it. The 'munchies' as we call it, is probably one of pots well know and best effects especially for sweet and savory food. Pot also increases food enjoyment and interest. The substance that causes high in smoking trees is what taps into the brain to control appetite.

8._**Use large plates**_

This sounds funny right but it is actually a very efficient strategy. Using a large plate creates the illusion in your mind that you are eating less food and as a result you can be able to eat more food instead of piling food on a small plate. Using a large plate will make you serve more food even if you do not really like the food.

_**If after using all these strategies, you are still struggling with your appetite, then you may have an underlying medical condition, a physical condition, maybe you are on medication and maybe you have vitamin/mineral deficiencies. Your appetite may also decrease if you are sad, depressed, anxious, bored or stressed. If your appetite problem does not change with all these strategies, then you should definitely seek help from a doctor who will find out what is really causing the situation and recommend some supplements for you before you develop other conditions such as extreme fatigue, weight loss, fever and even irritability and crankiness.**_
