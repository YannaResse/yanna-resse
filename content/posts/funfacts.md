Watching movies is one of the ways i think most of you are using to cope with the ongoing quarantine. Whether it's just netflix or dstv or youtube, we are all just watching show after show and thanks to the internet there are so many shows to watch. You can binge watch animated sitcoms, horror movies, comedy shows, romance movies, reality shows and even nature oriented movies and series. If you are a fun of animations or reality shows, i have outlined the must watch for each and they have more than enough episodes to keep you entertained as you chill at home. So if your bored, you should definitely watch something on TV.

#### NINE: _**READ A BOOK**_

"Did she just write \_**READ A BOOK**\_because that sounds boring". I know this is what most of you are prolly thinking. Well, yes i did say read a book but am not referring to the boring educational ones, am talking about movie oriented novels such as Harry Potter and Fifty Shades Of Grey. If you happen to have interesting novels such as this at home, you can try reading them. If you are like me and don't own physical copies of books, then you can try visiting sites such as Wattpad or Google Books where you can get your favourite books online. If you just can't stand reading at all, you can listen to audiobooks instead. If you have no idea what those are, lemme break it down for you. Audiobooks are recordings of a person reading mostly novels but also other books as well. All you gotta do is look for the audiobook of something interesting and sit back and listen as someone reads your book for you, all you're left to do is to allow your mind to drift to imagination as you visualize the events happening in the book.

#### EIGHT: _**FACE TIME WITH FRIENDS**_

We've been indoors too long and for most of us who have goofy friends, we miss them and would like to spend time with them because our friends always have something interesting lined up for us to do, whether its gossip or doing something cheesy. Thanks to social media, we are able to face time with our friends from wherever they are. This will help to reduce the anxiety that most people have of wanting to rush to get out there just because they wanna chill with they friends and you will feel as though your friends are right there with you.

#### SEVEN: _**PLAY BOARD GAMES/CARDS**_

If you are tired of the internet, you can decide to switch things up by playing a board game or cards, just don't play Jumanji because we're already living in one. Playing card games for example poker or board games for example chess with a wager in mind makes things interesting. Naturally people like competition and they especially love receiving recognition for being the best at something. So if you play either of this games and put a worthy wager, you can take a short break from the internet and still end up doing something fun.

#### SIX: _**LISTEN TO MUSIC AND DANCE**_

Music is the window to the soul and there are various genres of music depending on a person's taste. So if you haven't tried this yet, please do. You can listen to rock, RnB, Pop, Hiphop, Trap, Gengetone among others. Since you are in the comfort of your homes and ain't nobody watching, you can decide to buss down some moves. If you don't know how to dance, watch youtube tutorials and attempt a move and if you like how you move it, record it and post it up on social media #No judgement.

#### FIVE: _**READ BLOG POSTS**_

If you know any blogger, am sure they always got amazing content lined up for you to read and it won't take you a long time to read one blog post. So if you got nothing to do, you can read blog posts from different bloggers depending on what you wanna read about. News blog pages can enable you to know what is happening around the world and you get all this knowledge right on your phone as long as you have WIFI/Airtime.

#### FOUR: _**TRY COOKING A NEW RECIPE**_

Thanks to being in quarantine, most of us have stocked our fridges with plenty of food because this helps to reduce our movements outside limiting our levels of exposure. So instead of eating the usual recipes we are used to, we can try spicing things up in order to improve the taste and quality of our foods. Trying new recipes will definitely keep you busy during quarantine, moreover, it will help you create the illusion of being in a restaurant with the added bonus that the food is free because you created the fancy meal all on your own. Trying new recipes is fun and it also reduces the urge of wanting to visit various food joints ensuring your following the directive of staying at home which results into you being safe.
