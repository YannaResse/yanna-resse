Welcome to my blog YANNA RESSE. My blog is divided into two; THE LIFESTYLE SECTION and THE MAKEUP SECTION. The LIFESTYLE SECTION contains recommendations of different things that surround our day to day lives such as what restaurants to visit, what clubs are popping, which nganya's are the best, what foods should you order at the recommended restaurants, what movies/animations should you watch and abit of advise about relationships and friendships. The MAKEUP SECTION on the other hand is about the different cosmetics people use and which ones are the best for your skin types, where to shop for quality makeup on a budget and also short tutorials that will help you apply makeup like a pro.
