#### LINKOSI CLOTHING

![L&C](./img/evening.jpg)

Linkosi Clothing was founded in 2019 by its CEO, Linkosi. I interviewed him about his inspiration behind the clothing brand and here is what he had to say and i quote,"I was inspired by the repetition of similar designs and i thought of coming up with something creative and unique at least to erase the rate of common attires." With that dream in mind, he went ahead to put it into reality and created a brand for himself, Linkosi Clothing, otherwise known as L&C, which is one of the leading fashion brands in Kenya which managed to scope an award for _**THE BEST CLOTHLINE BRAND OF THE YEAR IN 2019**_ at the XTREEM AWARDS

I absolutely love all their outfits but am a sucker for croptops, because anything with them in it is a total vibe. But loving croptops is not for everyone of course, so if its not your thing,

Aside from all these amazing designs, L&C recently launched a series known as _**THE C SERIES**_. What is the C SERIES?
The C series is an introduction that focuses much on the voice of the woman in the society. However, it does not only focus on this but also adds unity and celebrating diversity.

All this is gonna be incorporated in the different outfit designs. The main idea behind this, is to create awareness that people come from different backgrounds and each of us needs to be appreciated and celebrated. So what are you waiting for, support the movement in solidarity by getting yourself an outfit such as the ones below today before the end of the series in October.

_**Q/A PORTION**_

#### Who are the brains behind L&C?

So i asked Linkosi if he had a team who come up with these amazing ideas and he said,"No, i do not have a team. I do more research as an individual and come up with the ideas." A pretty outstanding guy, don't you think?

I also asked what L&C had to offer us in future and he said,"Nothing will remain constant, roots will be extended from garments to accesories, shoes and many more."
