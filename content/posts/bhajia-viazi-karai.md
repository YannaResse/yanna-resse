Bhajias and Viazi karai are delicious Swahili dishes that many people would love to know how to make but they do not know how to prepare it. Here's my step by step recipe for how i made bhajias and viazi karai for the first time. The procedure is similar but there are just a few slight differences between making both as you shall see. Bhajias and viazi karai are usually taken with ukwaju but they can be taken with ketchup as well if you lack the ukwaju.

#### HOW TO MAKE BHAJIA

##### INGREDIENTS

5 large potatoes

1 and 1/2 cups of home baking flour

1 tsp red chilli powder

Salt to taste

2 ginger roots

4 cloves of garlic

2 tsp tumeric powder

3 green chillies

Water to make a pancake like batter consistency

Cooking oil enough for deep frying

##### DIRECTIONS

1. Wash and peele all the potatoes.

2. Slice the potatoes into thin slices using a knife. This ensures they cook through.

3. Wash the ginger, garlic and green chillies and crush them into a paste which you will then add to the home baking flour along with the chilli powder, salt and tumeric powder. Mix everything together to ensure that all these ingredients are evenly distributed in the flour.

4. Add water in small amounts while continously stirring until all the flour is well mixed. Once the batter is at a consistency of moderately thick, stop adding water.

5. Pour oil onto a pan and heat on medium heat until it becomes moderately hot. This ensures the bhajias do not get burnt.

6. Take the potato slices and dip them into the batter one vy one making sure they are well coated before adding them to the heated oil.

7. Cook the bhajias for 1 and 1/2 minutes on each side or until the flour is golden brown and crispy on all sides.

8. Serve while hot and enjoy.
