#### _**THE SECRETS TO WIN YOUR GIRL'S HEART WHEN ITS YOUR FAULT SHE'S UPSET**_

![relationships](./img/couple3.jpg)

No relationships lack quarrels and misunderstandings. Don't let nobody fool you otherwise and tell you that everything in a relationship is all bright colours and rainbows because arguments between people happen all the time and people are prone to get upset. The strength that couples have to move past that particular situation is what makes them more solid and long lasting.

One can argue that ladies are the most complicated people to understand but that is entirely not the case. Both ladies and gentlemen are complex creatures and this complexity may be as a result of individuals having different backgrounds and how that influences their choices and decisions as they develop their own vitues to guide them in their lives overtime, so complexity is an integral part of a humanbeing. For ladies, since they are delicate, each of them should be handled differently and men take a seat because am about to spill the tea.....

(1) _**LET HER VENT OUT ALL HER FRUSTRATIONS**_

![relationships](./img/arguing.jpg)

So something went down between you and bae and one thing lead to another, now y'all are just basically raising your voices at each other and not giving a fuck what the other person has to say because in each of your minds, well, u believe you are the one whose right. If you ever get to this situation, as the guy just let your girl vent out all her frustrations in a runt. Under all circumstances, and guys please heed to this, DO NOT INTERRUPT HER. If you do you probably won't even get a chance to speak. Once she's done runting, you can then speak and let her know your version of events and tell her where she went wrong. If you do this, she will probably hear you out because she will be at a calmer state of mind. From here, you can just unpack the issue in a more sensible manner and find a solution that automatically results in your girl not being upset.

(2) _**DON'T POINT OUT WHAT SHE DID WRONG WHILE YA'LL ARE ARGUING**_

![relationships](./img/point.jpg)

If you are to blame for causing the argument and bae happens to have also contributed to that argument, don't start pointing out what she did wrong in the middle of the heated exchange in order to level out the playing field because this will only provoke her to get even more upset because it's a clear sign that you are not listening to what she has to say therefore, you aren't paying attention to her. Ladies are attention magnets and they love to be heard especially in an argument. So let her point out what you did wrong at that moment she's upset and you just sit and quietly analyse her role in the situation, once she's done, let her know how she contributed to the situation getting outta control and she will willingly listen therefore, because she would have come down thus will not be upset.

(3) _**TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS**_

![relationships](./img/couple2.jpg)

Most ladies hate it when they have to spell it out for you what you did wrong to make them upset. They want you to be able to recognise your mistake on your own and then own up to it. One mistake that the marjority of guys make is assuming that the mistake was not a big deal, something not worth apologising for. But as a guy, you gotta know that this is your girl and if you do something to her, no matter how small it is, as long as it upset her, you should definitely own up to your mistake. Not dragging an apology out of you will definitely get your girl to handle the situation better and not get upset.

(4) _**APOLOGIZE TO YOUR GIRL BY SAYING SORRY**_

![relationships](./img/sorry.jpg)

After acknowledging your mistake, it's only sensible that you apologise by saying sorry. Hearing the words "Am sorry"coming from your mouth is all it takes to ease the tension. If for example, you are in the middle of an intense argument, just allow yourselves to first and foremost calm down, and if you are the person responsible for the argument, then say something like "Am sorry babe" or whatever sweet names ya'll call each other.

(5) _**WALK AWAY AND GIVE HER TIME**_

![relationships](./img/walkaway.jpg)

For most ladies, i can attest to this, we hate it when someone pissess us off and the contionously keep apologising for that mistake, this only makes a person even more upset. I prefer that if you pissed me off, just walk away and let me calm down on my own and when i come around, i will be in a better position to hear you out and also figure out how i contributed to the intense exchange if we were having an argument. So guys after apologising, just walk away and give your girl sometime, she will come around when shes ready to talk things out. All you gotta do is to have patience.

(6) _**TELL HER YOU LOVE HER**_

![relationships](./img/nottalking.jpg)

You and bae had an argument right? Y'all still in your feelings and because both of y'all got matching egos, a'int nobody finna talk to the other. Well, you don't have to talk to each other, you can just text her something cheesy yet true like "I love you, always have and always will" , she may not respond at that moment but if she truly loves you like you do her then she will probably say something like "I love you too, always have and alwaya will" she may then add something like"But why do we keep going at it like this. I don't like it when we fight". A statement such as this one just shows that y'all are ready to deal with the situation that triggered the intense argument. Guys, showing your girl that you love her by letting her know even when your both not on speaking terms, just proves how much your care for her and value her and this can very much help to ease intense altrications.

(7) _**GET HER A GIFT**_

![relationships](./img/gift3.jpg)

Getting your girl a gift entirely depends on the situation that y'all are in. If you have upset your girl and she has not spoken to you in a while, means that she needs more from you than just a simple "Am sorry". Ladies love to be pampered with meaningful gifts because it shows just how important she is to you, so go out of your way and get her something meaningful. It doesn't have to be the cliche flowers and chocolates gift, think out of the box and try something different that you know she will appreciate. A meaningful gesture such as, cooking her favourite meal if you know how to cook, taking her out to her favourite restaurant, if she loves oroes, get her that, if she loves ice cream, get her that etc. This basically proves to your girl what her worth is to you and that you are not willing to lose her over a petty argument for example. This gesture shows her how y'all go hard or ride for each other, if she was upset with you, she will easily let it go and you are in the clear.

(8) _**NOBODY OWES YOU FORGIVENESS**_

![relationships](./img/forgiveness.jpg)

So you and bae had an argument and things escalated beyond repair. You followed all the tips i have outlined for you but you still haven't been forgiven. What next? Well, forgiveness is a long process and some wounds take time to heal depending on the intensity of the hurt, it happens at one's own pace and time. You may not be forgiven now, but you may be forgiven later. That may also not entirely be the case as your girl may never want to forgive you for what you did to them, and if they do forgive you, you already burnt that bridge and they may never want you in their life again. This can be a hard pill to swallow but it is something that you gotta accept. What you can do in such a situation is to move on with your life and figure out how you can do better in future.

#### _**DISCLAIMER**_

The process of taking responsibility for your actions is about addressing the needs of the person you hurt and not wallowing in the guilt of the mistake you made because ain't nobody in this earth who is perfect, we all make mistakes and if a person cannot forgive you for making the mistake and hurting them, and you did all you could to do right by them, the what are you gonna do other than walk away?

![relationships](./img/walkaway2.jpg)

But then again, we are all equally responsible for our actions, so do not go burning bridges with the notion that "Yanna said were humans thus are subject to make mistakes" to justify your hurtful actions because that's just being a shitty human being!!
