### K1 Klub House

![K1](./img/kone2.jpg)

If you are a fun of the Nairobi night life the you ought to go and enjoy a night out at The K1 Klub House located at Parklands off Ojijo Road. If you wanna try somethimg different such as listening to slow and live jazz music played by a band instead of the usual mixed dj versions played in clubs, they've got you covered, but don't get me wrong, they not only play jazz music, they play all genres of music. Aside from the music and partying element of the club, they also have a great food menu and since am a big fan of fries, i decided to order chips masala. Chips Masala takes fries to a whole other more tasty level. They are crispy, saucy, spicy and they contain masala which is used to perfectly coat the fries improving their flavour. At K1 Klub House, the chips masala is usually served with a bit of salad on the side and is taken with any drink. It can also be taken with fried foods such as chicken.
