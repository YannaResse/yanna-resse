### 6 SECRETS TO SINCERE FRIENDS

1.  _**BEING TRUTHFUL AT ALL TIMES DESPITE THE SITUATION**_

Many friends are usually not that honest because of being afraid to hurt their friends' feelings. My friends usually dont sugarcoat anything, they'd rather rip the bandaide out because its better to know the truth than being fed lies which will eventually lead to having more lies in order to cover up those lies and once a lie is uncovered amid other lies the whole relationship breaks. Honesty is essential for any relationship especially friendship to work, so if you wanna be a sincere friend be honest at all times and if its somethimg difficult for you to be honest about, put yourself in the other person's shoes and find the right words to express yourself in order to avoid sounding rude or negative.

2.  _**HAVING CLEAR BOUNDARIES IN YOUR FRIENDSHIPS**_

Every single relationship has boundaries. In friendships this is very important. In order for one to sincere, you need to establish boundaries such that if one is crossed you can openly talk about it and go straight to the point. Boundaries enable one to tell their relationships limits. This is similar to developing a code, if you as friends have a code you will be able to establish honesty within your relationship without even trying.

3.  _**AVOID BEING JUDGEMENTAL**_

For a relationship to have a strong bond with utmost honesty, one should avoid being judgy with everything. Yes, you should be sincere but this does not necessarily mean you should judge others, instaed you should try to understand you friends from their point of view rather than using your own virtues to create an impression of them thus being a friend who's only value is to get in their friends' way and make them feel less than because of choosing to be on the high horse.

4.  _**BEING A FRIEND WHO ALWAYS KEEPS THEIR WORD**_

Part of being a sincere friend means that you always keep your promises to your friends. Do not be the type of friend who only talks cheap but follow your words with actions. This gives you credibility with your friends because they know you don't falter from your words making you a very truthful friend which will in turn also rub off on your friends just like the saying birds of the same feather flock together,they will eventually embrace the virtue making you and your friends as honest as can be.

5. _**BEING A FRIEND WHO MAKES AMENDS WHEN THEY MAKE MISTAKES**_

Nobody is perfect. We are all flawed in one way or another so we should readily take responsibility if we wrong our friends. Sincere friends will always admit their mistakes openly without letting you go through the trouble of dragging out the whole situation just to them thair wrongs and let them acknowledge their actions. The first step to forgiveness is admission of guilt, if you openly own your mistakes, you display the quality of being a sincere friend.

6. _**HAVING CLEAR LOYALTYS TO YOUR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS**_

Loyalty is a key trait in sincere friends. Nobody wants a friend who is trifling towards them and is quick to throw them under the bus. For you to achieve sincerity in your friendship, you have to have allegiance to your friends wellbeing and interests to the extent that anybody who does not like any of your friends will avoid bashing any of your friends before you. This particular quality enables you to be someone who is trustworthy in all circumstances thus being considered a sincere friend.
