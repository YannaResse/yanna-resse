Most of us who have eaten pizza, we've definetely gone to pizza inn. Pizza Inn is a pizza serving restaurant located in multiple places in Nairobi. It has a variety of amazing pizzas to choose from, my absolute fav being the Barbeque Steak flavour.

But i also like the Hawaiian pizza flavour, mostly because of the pineapple toppings, it's debatable because they're people who don't like the sugary effect of the pineapple toppings as it combines with the sauce ans the rest of the toppings on the pizza, that preference is purely based on a person's taste.

Once you take the first bite of the slice of pizza, the greasy effect of the cheese warms your mouth and as you go deeper into the crust, you can taste the lean savory pieces of meat as it combines with the other toppings. The pizza is taken with any fizzy drink or even a milkshake, there are some who also prefer having pizza with a pitcher of beer, the choice is entirely dependent on you. The service at pizza inn is moderately fast especially on Tuesdays because thats one of the days many people choose to eat pizza because of the 2 for 1 offer which is offered in all pizza inn outlets. Pizza Inn is one of the best and well established pizza restaurant.

#### WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR

Pizza Inn on days such as Tuesdays, has a lot of people so if you want to enjoy your pizza in the restaurant you have to arrive a bit early in order for you to get a spot to seat and enjoy your pizza, also ,arrive early to get a place to sit as you wait for your pizza to get ready, that is if you decided to carry your pizza as takeaway.
